A zip file containing the full R2RML project can be downloaded from this
URL:

In this directory, the lib/ directory also contains the core and bridge
jar files that are needed to use the API.  In order to run the Sesame
and Jena tests, these libraries have to be downloaded separately.  The
jar file for OWL API is included.
